This repository contains two kinds of contents
    - codes and materials that I learn Operating System
    - codes and materials that I learn C programming language

# OperatingSystems
This repository contains source codes and materials about OS.
Because almost knowledge and skills about C programming language have been learned with learning OS. So this repository contains a folder
called C_programming_language which contains some examples for clarifying features in C.
